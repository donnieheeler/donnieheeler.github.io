        <td>Got the site to a semi-usable state today. Feels good. Need to put together a roadmap—got a few ideas I want to dive into.

            Been looking for a more organized way to work on and document projects. Also been reading The Friends of Eddie Coyle by George V. Higgins. Writing a novel has been going fine, but I needed a break to shake off the dust of work. Wanted something quick and fun, but good—something interesting.

            Just a quick start to the system; I haven’t been reading much. Holding the string of focus between my fingers gets fatiguing, and after a while, your hands start to shake. Then you can’t focus on anything. So you have to take a break. You have to rest your mind, or you risk snapping that string altogether.

            So I got this book. It’s good so far. Dominated by dialogue—almost makes me sick sometimes. Can’t wait to read more.</td>

        <td>At work now. Happy it's Friday. Going to be even happier once I'm out of here. Got two beers at home with my name on it and a high potential three day weekend. 
            Going to also start working on the baseball section of my website. On the "Cards" section I want the homepage to be a binder layout that matches my real life baseball card binder.
            Then each card can be clickable. I should actually start with the current projects tracker on the front of the website. This will help guide the ideas.</td>

        <td>Still at work. Almost ready to hit the road. Worked on some of the Baseball / Card page and it's looking solid. Going to go with a modual system though I have to make sure that the cards get resized
        and actually look good when they get "modualed". Should be easy since they get resized to fit in the Binder display. Glad to be going home in just five minutes.</td>

        <tr>
        <td>Made leaps and bounds on the Baseball/Cards section. It is developing slowly but with pinpoint accuracy. I'd much rather take it slow but know what's going on. I almost lost the trail a few times doing some of the Javascript stuff. 
        I don't want to get hung up on it though so tomorrow I will just stick to scanning or working on something else.</td>
