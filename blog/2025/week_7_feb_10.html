        <tr>
        <td>Got the site to a semi-usable state today. Feels good. Need to put together a roadmap—got a few ideas I want to dive into.

            Been looking for a more organized way to work on and document projects. Also been reading The Friends of Eddie Coyle by George V. Higgins. Writing a novel has been going fine, but I needed a break to shake off the dust of work. Wanted something quick and fun, but good—something interesting.

            Just a quick start to the system; I haven’t been reading much. Holding the string of focus between my fingers gets fatiguing, and after a while, your hands start to shake. Then you can’t focus on anything. So you have to take a break. You have to rest your mind, or you risk snapping that string altogether.

            So I got this book. It’s good so far. Dominated by dialogue—almost makes me sick sometimes. Can’t wait to read more.</td>
