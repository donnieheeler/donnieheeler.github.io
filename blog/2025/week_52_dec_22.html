        <td>It is X-Mas Eve and I am at work. About to be off though. I believe we are due to be off at 1:00 PM. At least that's what 
          I've heard from the other people at my job. I'm all packed and ready to go. Lots to do today, but I think for the next few 
          hours I'm just gonna be chilling mostly. Gonna go get some cookie related stuff but that's pretty much it. Wrapped everything 
          I need for tonight. Hope everyone likes their gifts. Felt like I could've done better on the gift giving. Guess I can try to 
          be a better family member during the year in 2026. I know next year there will be a lot of changes, and I see a lot of them as positive. 
          Hopefully I'm right.
