        <td>Been living life a little vulgarly. Want to pull the reigns back, slow things down, but feel as though to really enjoy myself I have to keep the speed. Insane pace. If anything, when I really start to think about things I find myself thinking I should pick up the pace. Going to try and live a little more seriously I guess. Start feeling the pain again. Been only finding snakes whenever I turnover stones. That's why I gotta stretch my legs. Move around. Smell the air. Let my self remember the gardens I once underappreciated.</td>
