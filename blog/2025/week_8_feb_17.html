        <td>Just got home from Knott's. Been doing a year long run of the park with parking and food and the whole deal. Wanted to see if somehow we could go at least once a year in order to have a non stop experience. They just did the Charlie Brown / Peanuts 
        celebration and it is pretty nice. Have been grinding my website so was nice to take a little break. Still have a few things to develop but it's already going so great. Still need to do some literature stuff, a movie thing, the "working on now" thing, 
        and I believe that is most everything for now. Still got to find tune things like the baseball card display but it already looks very great.</td>
