        <td><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today was tough. From the moment my eyes opened. Maybe even before then. While I was just laying there. Guessing the time in my head.
      Then the day went by. Terrible. 
      <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then it ended, and real life began. Cleaned a bit. Then I worked on this site. Now I am going to choose a book to read.
      Tomorrow I should do laundry, or clean some more. But I definitely need to work out as I did not do it today. Tsk, tsk. For tonight I just need to pick a book. Fool around. Then fall asleep. 
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wish me luck.</td>
