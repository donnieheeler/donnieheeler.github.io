        <td><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today was tough. From the moment my eyes opened. Maybe even before then. While I was just laying there. Guessing the time in my head.
      Then the day went by. Terrible. 
      <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then it ended, and real life began. Cleaned a bit. Then I worked on this site. Now I am going to choose a book to read.
      Tomorrow I should do laundry, or clean some more. But I definitely need to work out as I did not do it today. Tsk, tsk. For tonight I just need to pick a book. Fool around. Then fall asleep. 
        <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wish me luck.</td>

        <td><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Busy day again. Less evil though. Not much for me to accomplish. Just trying not to stand in busy doorways. Got around an hour left. 
        Wondering if I'll be able to go home at my regular time or if I'll be stuck here. Who knows? I don't.</td>
