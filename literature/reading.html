            <p><i>Review written March 26, 2023 @ Instagram Stories:</i>
				<br><br>Banger! A short book. 
				Easy to read. What if the cells in our bodies developed high intelligence 
				and could modify our bodies. Spooky. Body horror and science fiction. 
				At times feels like cosmic or divine horror. Really fun to read. Weirdly deep 
				and though provoking. Deals with ideas of societal direction and cooperation. 
				Themes of identity and of genetic identity. Written in 1983 but feels so fresh. 
				New personal all time favorite. If you want to read something actually cool this is it. 
				Highly recommend.</p>
