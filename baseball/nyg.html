    <p><strong>May 5th, 1904, Letter from Manager Donnie Heeler</strong></p>
    <p> &emsp;With less than two months left in the season, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude—to our players, our staff, and our fans. This journey has tested us in ways we never imagined. The injuries have piled up. We’ve lost Mark Brooks for two months, John Casey for nine, Cody Merritt for a week, and Newton Pederson for four. At times, it has felt like bad luck was determined to drag us down.

    <br><br>&emsp;But we haven’t backed down. We’ve remained competitive. We’ve returned to the fundamentals, cleaned up our game, and adapted when needed. Our bullpen has stepped up, our depth has been tested, and through it all, we’ve kept ourselves at the top of the standings.

    <br><br>&emsp;No matter how this season ends, I am proud of this team. We have fought to etch our names into the history books, and no one can deny our strength, resilience, and determination. I consider it a privilege to lead this ballclub.

    <br><br>&emsp;Now, we finish strong. There is still baseball left to play, and we will play it the only way we know how—with everything we have.

    <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;<i>Gargoyles Forever!</i>

<p>
  The New York Gargoyles endured a frustrating road trip to Tijuana, dropping two of three against the Calaveras for their first series loss of the season. 
  The normally resilient Gargoyles couldn't muster enough timely offense, falling short in consecutive close games after taking the opener. 
  To make matters worse, Mark Brooks suffered an injury, adding another name to the team’s growing list of sidelined players.
</p>

<p>

<p>
  Game 2 was a frustrating night for the Gargoyles, as errors and missed opportunities allowed the Calaveras to take a 7-4 victory. 
  Trevor Yale battled through six innings, but defensive mistakes behind him led to unearned runs that proved costly.
</p>

<p>
  Tijuana’s Zach Harris delivered the biggest blow, driving in two runs in the first inning to put the Gargoyles in an early hole. 
  Despite a solid effort from the lineup—including a three-run fourth inning to briefly take the lead—New York couldn’t hold off the Calaveras’ relentless attack.
</p>

<p>
  Mark Brooks suffered an injury in the fourth inning, forcing New York to scramble with their lineup. 
  His absence was immediately felt, as the offense struggled in key moments down the stretch.

  After a dramatic walk-off win in Game 1, New York dropped the second game in a late-inning heartbreak before bouncing back 
  with a thrilling 1-0 victory in the finale.
</p>

</p>

<p>
  Despite the setback, New York improved to 26-10 on the year and remains one of the league’s elite teams.

</p>

<p>
  The Gargoyles took an early lead on Francisco Cabanas' RBI double but saw Detroit tie it in the middle innings.

  The offense struggled against Mike Simpson, who kept the Gargoyles in check for most of the night.
</p>

<p>
  The loss was frustrating, but the bigger concern was Newton Pederson, who left the game with an injury and will now miss five weeks. 
  This latest blow adds to a growing list of injuries that have tested New York's depth.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 3: Dove Walks It Off as Gargoyles Win 1-0</strong></p>

</p>

<p>
  Steve Erickson (5-1) picked up another win in relief, continuing his dominance. The victory gave New York the series win,

			<p><strong>Series Recap: Gargoyles Get Battered, Bruised, and Barely Survive</strong></p>

<p>
  This trip to San Francisco started bad and somehow got even worse. Losing the series was one thing, but losing John Casey for the rest of the season? 
  That’s a full-on catastrophe. The Gargoyles' starting catcher, game-caller, and defensive anchor behind the plate is gone for 10 months with a torn PCL. 
  And if that wasn’t enough, Cody Merritt will be out for the next four weeks with a herniated disc.
</p>

<p>
  It was the kind of series where nothing seemed to go right.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 1: 9-6 Loss – Too Many Mistakes, Too Many Missed Chances</strong></p>
<p>
  New York racked up 14 hits against David Brancheau, but somehow only managed six runs—not nearly enough to keep pace with the Dogs. 
  Brancheau didn’t strike out a single batter, but the Gargoyles kept hitting into outs at the worst possible times. 
  San Francisco took the lead for good with a four-run sixth, and New York just couldn’t recover.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 2: 2-0 Loss – Marshall Rohwer Shuts the Door</strong></p>
<p>
  This one was even more frustrating. The Gargoyles actually had 12 hits. TWELVE. And yet, they scored zero runs. 
  Rohwer somehow worked around all the traffic on the bases and blanked New York for a complete-game shutout. 
  The Gargoyles wasted multiple scoring opportunities and just never delivered the big hit.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 3: 5-3 Win (10 Innings) – Some Late-Inning Life</strong></p>
<p>
  New York salvaged the final game, but it wasn’t easy. Mark Brooks’ clutch RBI single in the 10th finally put the Gargoyles ahead, 
  and Ruben Leiva added insurance with another base hit. Trevor Yale pitched well, and the bullpen held on just long enough. 
  It was an important win, but the celebration was muted—because by that point, the damage was already done.
</p>

<p><strong>The Bigger Problem: Life Without John Casey</strong></p>
<p>
  Let’s be real. The real story of this series isn’t what happened on the scoreboard—it’s what happened to John Casey. 
  Losing a starting catcher for 10 months is a nightmare scenario. He was the leader behind the plate, the guy controlling the pitching staff, 
  and an underrated bat in the lineup. There’s no easy replacement for that.
</p>

<p>
  Who steps up now? The backup options aren’t great, and New York might have to start looking for outside help. 
  Trading for a catcher this early in the season isn’t ideal, but the team might not have a choice.
</p>

<p>
  Oh, and if things weren’t bad enough… the Houston Cows are next. One of the best teams in the league, waiting to pounce on a suddenly vulnerable Gargoyles squad. 
  This stretch of the season just turned into survival mode.
</p>

<p>
  The next few weeks will tell us what this team is really made of.

			<p><strong>Gargoyles Take Series in Long Beach, But Fall Short of the Sweep</strong></p>

<p>
  The New York Gargoyles secured another series victory on the road against the Long Beach Bastards, taking two of three in a set filled 
  with history, fireworks, and heartbreak. The highlight of the series was Trevor Yale’s perfect game, a feat that will be etched into 
  Gargoyles history forever. Game 2 delivered one of the wildest moments of the season with an inside-the-park grand slam, while Game 3 
  saw New York come up just short in extra innings.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 1: Trevor Yale Throws First Perfect Game in Gargoyles History, 2-0</strong></p>

<p><strong>27 up. 27 down. Perfection.</strong></p>

<p>
  In one of the most dominant pitching performances in baseball history, Trevor Yale became immortal by throwing the first perfect game 
  in New York Gargoyles history. Over nine flawless innings, Yale retired all 27 batters he faced, striking out six and never allowing 
  a single baserunner. His mix of breaking balls and pinpoint fastballs kept Long Beach hitters guessing all night.
</p>

<p>
  "His breaking pitches had more movement than I've ever seen from Trevor," said manager Donnie Heeler. "By the 7th, we all knew. 
  By the 9th, it felt like fate."
</p>

<p>
  Offensively, New York only needed a Mark Brooks triple in the 4th and a Ramon Saravia RBI single in the 7th to secure the 2-0 win. 
  But this game wasn't about the offense—it was about Yale etching his name into history.
</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Trevor Yale: 9.0 IP, 0 H, 0 BB, 6 K (Perfect Game)</li>
  <li>First perfect game in Gargoyles franchise history</li>
  <li>Defensive Perfection: New York’s defense was flawless, converting every opportunity.</li>
  <li>A Milestone Night: Yale now holds a 1.62 ERA on the season as he continues his elite start.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Game 2: Inside-the-Park Grand Slam Sparks 9-5 Win</strong></p>

<p>
  Game 2 was chaotic, intense, and unforgettable. What started as a tight battle took a turn for the wild in the 8th inning, 
  when Chris Hawthorne delivered one of the most electrifying plays of the season: an inside-the-park grand slam.
</p>

<p>
  With the bases loaded, Hawthorne sent a deep drive into center, where a misplay by the Long Beach outfield sent the ball rolling 
  all the way to the wall. By the time the defense recovered, Hawthorne was flying around third, sliding home safely to put the Gargoyles ahead for good.
</p>

<p>
  "I just kept running. I saw Coach waving me in, and I wasn't stopping," Hawthorne said after the game.
</p>

<p>
  Earlier in the game, John Casey suffered a knee injury sliding into third base, forcing backup catcher Alex Roberts into action. 
  Casey’s diagnosis is still pending, but he is expected to miss some time.
</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Hawthorne’s Inside-the-Park Grand Slam: A season-defining moment.</li>
  <li>Clutch Hitting Late: New York scored six runs in the 8th to steal the win.</li>
  <li>Casey’s Injury: The Gargoyles’ starting catcher is out indefinitely.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Game 3: Bastards Walk It Off in Extras, Avoid Sweep, 2-1 (10 Innings)</strong></p>

<p>
  New York nearly completed the series sweep, but missed opportunities and a costly wild pitch in the 10th led to a heartbreaking loss. 
  The Gargoyles out-hit Long Beach 8-5, but struggled to bring runners home, stranding 11 on base.
</p>

<p>
  Greg McClay pitched a brilliant game, allowing just one run over eight innings. The Gargoyles tied the game in the 4th inning on a 
  Nick Dove RBI groundout, but never found the big hit needed to take the lead.
</p>

<p>
  In the 10th inning, Long Beach bunted the ghost runner to third, and on the next pitch, a wild pitch allowed the winning run to score. 
  A brutal way to end an otherwise dominant series.
</p>

<p><strong>Key Takeaways:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Missed Opportunities: Gargoyles left 11 runners stranded.</li>
  <li>McClay’s Strong Start: 8.0 IP, 5 H, 1 ER, 6 K—deserved a win.</li>
  <li>Costly Wild Pitch: Steve Erickson’s wild pitch in the 10th sealed New York’s fate.</li>

			<p><strong>PERFECTION IN LONG BEACH: YALE MAKES HISTORY WITH GARGOYLES’ FIRST PERFECT GAME</strong></p>

<p>
  For the first time in franchise history, the New York Gargoyles have a perfect game to their name—courtesy of Trevor Yale.
</p>

<p>
  The 27-year-old right-hander delivered one of the most dominant, historic, and unforgettable performances the team has ever seen, 
  retiring all 27 batters he faced in a 2-0 win over the Long Beach Bastards. It wasn’t just a no-hitter. It wasn’t just a shutout. 
  It was perfection.
</p>

<p><strong>Locked In From the First Pitch</strong></p>
<p>
  From the moment he stepped on the mound at Bastards Park, Yale was in complete control. His breaking stuff had more bite than ever, 
  his fastball was painting the corners, and Long Beach’s hitters had no answers.
</p>

<p>
  “I knew he was dealing early,” said Gargoyles manager Donnie Heeler. “But around the 6th or 7th, you could feel it. The guys in the dugout stopped talking to him. The tension started building. At this point, Adam Brock, our bench coach, was ready to go with the standard pitching change, and I stopped him. I just had this feeling. And then, by the 9th, we all knew—he was about to make history.”
</p>

<p><strong>A Masterpiece, One Out at a Time</strong></p>
<p>
  Yale recorded six strikeouts, induced a handful of weak grounders and pop-ups, and got flawless defense behind him. 
  Every pitch mattered, and every out brought him one step closer to immortality.
</p>

<p>
  The biggest moment? The final batter. With two outs in the ninth, pinch hitter Pat Wilson stepped in, hoping to break up the perfecto. 
  Yale wasted no time, attacking with back-to-back filthy sliders that Wilson couldn’t touch. One more breaking ball, a swing and a miss—
  and the Gargoyles stormed the mound in celebration.
</p>

<p>
  “It didn’t really hit me until I saw my teammates running toward me,” Yale said, still trying to process the moment after the game. 
  “I’ve never felt anything like it.”
</p>

<p><strong>An Offense That Did Just Enough</strong></p>
<p>
  While Yale was untouchable on the mound, New York’s bats had to grind for their runs. Mark Brooks’ fourth-inning triple led to 
  the first score of the game when Cody Merritt drove him in with a groundout. Then, in the seventh, Newton Pederson and Ruben Ortega 
  set the table, and Ramon Saravia knocked in an insurance run to give Yale some breathing room.
</p>

<p>
  It turned out that two runs were more than enough.
</p>

<p><strong>Yale Joins Baseball’s Most Exclusive Club</strong></p>
<p>
  A perfect game is one of the rarest feats in baseball, a monumental achievement that cements Yale’s place in Gargoyles history.
</p>

<p>
  27 up. 27 down. No hits. No walks. No errors. No baserunners.
</p>

<p>
  Baseball doesn’t get any better than that.
</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways from the Night of Perfection:</strong></p>

<p><i>Yale’s Command Was Next-Level</i></p>
<p>His 1.62 ERA on the season is no fluke—he’s been pitching at an elite level, and now he’s got a perfect game to show for it.</p>

<p><i>Defense Stepped Up Big Time</i></p>
<p>While Yale was electric, his infielders and outfielders were rock solid behind him, converting every play without a misstep.</p>

<p><i>An Unforgettable Moment for the Franchise</i></p>
<p>This is New York’s first-ever perfect game—a milestone that won’t be forgotten anytime soon.</p>

<p>
  With the win, the Gargoyles improve to 16-3, but tonight, the standings take a backseat. 
  This night belongs to Trevor Yale, the ace who pitched a perfect game.

			<p><strong>GARGOYLES SWEEP STRUGGLING 410s, EXTEND WINNING STREAK TO FIVE</strong></p>

<p>
  The New York Gargoyles took care of business at home, sweeping the expansion Baltimore 410s in a three-game set at Gargoyles Field. 
  While the competition may not have been the strongest, New York capitalized on the opportunity, riding dominant pitching performances 
  and late-game offensive surges to extend their winning streak to five games.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 1: McClay Cruises as Gargoyles Coast to 8-1 Victory</strong></p>
<p>
  Greg McClay delivered a masterpiece in the series opener, tossing a complete-game three-hitter while striking out six. The left-hander 
  was in control from the jump, allowing just one run and keeping Baltimore’s offense silent.
</p>
<p>
  The game was tight through seven innings, with Baltimore holding a surprising 1-0 lead. But in the eighth, New York’s bats exploded 
  for eight runs, taking advantage of defensive miscues and shaky Baltimore relief pitching. Francisco Cabanas delivered a bases-clearing 
  triple, while Cody Merritt and Brian Wright chipped in with RBI singles to turn the game into a rout.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 2: Wirths and Erickson Lock It Down in 2-0 Nailbiter</strong></p>
<p>
  Mike Wirths and Steve Erickson combined for a dominant shutout in a tense, low-scoring affair. Wirths held Baltimore scoreless over 
  seven strong innings, scattering four hits while striking out five. Erickson took over in the eighth and worked out of a bases-loaded 
  jam in the ninth to secure the save.
</p>
<p>
  The Gargoyles scratched across both of their runs in the eighth, with Nick Dove delivering a clutch RBI single and John Casey adding 
  an insurance run. Despite multiple scoring opportunities, Baltimore’s anemic offense couldn’t find a way to break through.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 3: Late Inning Onslaught Lifts New York to 8-2 Win</strong></p>
<p>
  Baltimore made things interesting, tying the game 2-2 in the seventh, but the Gargoyles responded in dominant fashion. A seven-run 
  explosion in the eighth, capped by a solo homer from Cody Merritt and a bases-loaded walk from Casey, turned a tight contest into 
  a comfortable win.
</p>
<p>
  Pedro Pumroy was excellent, going 8.1 innings while allowing just two runs on four hits. Bob Miller recorded the final two outs to 
  close out the sweep.
</p>

<p><strong>Series Takeaways:</strong></p>

<p><i>McClay and Wirths Deliver Again</i></p>
<p>
  The rotation continues to shine, with both starters pitching deep into games and allowing just one run combined in their starts.
</p>

<p><i>Baltimore’s Inexperience Shows</i></p>
<p>
  The expansion 410s fought hard, but defensive mistakes and a lack of clutch hitting kept them from stealing a game.
</p>

<p><i>Merritt and Cabanas Finding Their Groove</i></p>
<p>
  Both hitters came through with key moments in the series, and their production will be crucial as New York moves into tougher competition.

			<p><strong>GARGOYLES OUTLAST GOLDMINERS IN GRITTY SERIES, PROVE THEIR CHAMPIONSHIP METTLE</strong></p>

<p>
  The New York Gargoyles just survived a war against the California Division-leading Sacramento Goldminers, 
  taking the series 2-1 in dramatic, hard-fought fashion. This wasn’t the kind of series that builds highlight reels—it was the kind that builds champions.
</p>

<p>
  Sacramento was as tough as advertised, but New York dug deep, proving they can win in clutch moments and battle against the league’s best. 
  With this series win, the Gargoyles now sit at 12-4, still among the top teams in the league.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 1: Goldminers Walk It Off in Gut-Wrenching Loss (2-1)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> A brutal way to start the series. The Gargoyles led most of the game, but one mistake—a bases-loaded walk in the ninth—handed Sacramento the win.</p>

<p><strong>Key Moments:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Mike Wirths was excellent (7 IP, 1 ER, 4 Ks) but got no run support.</li>
  <li>Nick Dove manufactured a run in the 6th with a steal and aggressive baserunning.</li>
  <li>Defensive mistakes & missed chances let Sacramento hang around—and they took advantage.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This loss stung, but the Gargoyles didn’t fold. Instead, they responded.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 2: Extra-Inning Grit, Dove & Merritt Deliver in Clutch (6-4, 10 Innings)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> Down late. Tied in extras. And then New York took over. This was a gritty, playoff-style win, where small moments and execution made the difference.</p>

<p><strong>Key Moments:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Trevor Yale battled (6 IP, 2 ER), keeping the Gargoyles in it.</li>
  <li>Nick Dove came through in extras, breaking the 3-3 tie in the 10th with a clutch RBI single.</li>
  <li>Cody Merritt & Newton Pederson added insurance, giving Steve Erickson enough cushion to lock down the save.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This was the kind of win that tough teams find a way to pull out—and New York did exactly that.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 3: Another Extra-Inning Classic, Elizondo Plays Hero (4-3, 10 Innings)</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> Another tense, grinding battle—another Gargoyles win. Sacramento’s Carlos Leon was dominant, going 10 innings, but Willie Elizondo came up huge off the bench to deliver the game-winner.</p>

<p><strong>Key Moments:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Carlos Gonzalez stepped up big (7 IP, 3 ER), proving he can handle big moments.</li>
  <li>Francisco Cabanas, Nick Dove, and Cody Merritt manufactured early runs with aggressive baserunning and smart hitting.</li>
  <li>Willie Elizondo’s pinch-hit RBI single in the 10th was the dagger.</li>
  <li>Steve Erickson shut it down once again, earning his third save of the series.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Winning back-to-back extra-inning games on the road against a division leader? That’s a championship mentality.
</p>

<p><strong>Series Takeaways: This Was a Test – And New York Passed</strong></p>

<p><i>This Team Doesn’t Break Under Pressure</i></p>
<p>Two extra-inning wins, one heartbreaker, no collapse. New York bounced back from Game 1 and found ways to win when it mattered most.</p>

<p><i>Steve Erickson Owns the Closer Role</i></p>
<p>Three saves in the series, all in tight games. He’s proving he can handle high-leverage moments.</p>

<p><i>Nick Dove & Cody Merritt Are Clutch</i></p>
<p>When the Gargoyles needed runs in extras, Dove and Merritt delivered. These guys are turning into big-time bats in crunch time.</p>

<p><i>The Pitching Stepped Up</i></p>
<p>Wirths, Yale, and Gonzalez all pitched well enough to win. The offense just didn’t break through until late.</p>

			<p><strong>GARGOYLES SWEEP CALAVERAS IN THRILLING SERIES, STAKE CLAIM AS LEGITIMATE CONTENDERS</strong></p>

<p>
  For years, the New York Gargoyles have been an afterthought. A team stuck in the cycle of rebuilding, falling short, and struggling to compete with the league’s best. Not anymore.
</p>

<p>
  This past series against the defending champion Tijuana Calaveras wasn’t just a battle—it was a declaration. The Gargoyles swept the powerhouse Calaveras in three unforgettable games, proving to the league (and themselves) that they belong at the top.
</p>

<p>
  Behind clutch hitting, dominant pitching, and a star-making performance from Newton Pederson, New York improved to 10-2, their best start in franchise history.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 1: Casey Walks It Off as New York Stuns Tijuana, 3-2</strong></p>
<p>
  Trevor Yale set the tone for the series with a dominant performance, tossing seven innings of one-run ball, keeping the powerful Calaveras lineup in check. Despite his brilliance, New York trailed 2-0 heading into the ninth.
</p>

<p><strong>Then, chaos unfolded.</strong></p>
<p>Francisco Cabanas led off with a single.</p>
<p>Nick Dove followed with another hit, and Cody Merritt loaded the bases.</p>
<p>Chris Hawthorne was hit by a pitch to force in a run.</p>
<p>Newton Pederson reached on an error, tying the game at 2-2.</p>
<p>And then, with two outs, John Casey laced a walk-off single, sending Gargoyles Field into a frenzy.</p>
<p>
  The win was a statement-maker, and the Gargoyles weren’t done yet.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 2: Pumroy Outduels Calaveras as New York Edges Tijuana, 2-1</strong></p>
<p>
  The spotlight shifted to Pedro Pumroy, and he delivered a masterpiece.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Complete-game, six-hit gem</li>
  <li>One earned run, one walk, one strikeout</li>
  <li>Absolute command over a championship-caliber lineup</li>
</ul>

<p>
  New York’s offense didn’t need much, and once again, Newton Pederson provided the heroics.
</p>

<p>
  Trailing 1-0 in the fourth, Pederson launched a towering two-run home run to left-center, putting New York ahead for good. Pumroy handled the rest, slamming the door in the ninth to lock down the biggest pitching performance of the season so far.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 3: Pederson Erupts as Gargoyles Complete the Sweep, 9-2</strong></p>
<p>
  If there were any doubts left about Newton Pederson’s superstar status, they were erased in Game 3.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>3-for-3, 2 home runs, 4 RBIs, 3 runs scored</li>
  <li>Took over the game and crushed Tijuana’s hopes of salvaging the series</li>
  <li>Led an offensive explosion that put the game out of reach</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Tijuana actually took a 2-1 lead in the fourth, but Pederson immediately answered, drilling a two-run shot to center to put New York ahead, 3-2. From there, the floodgates opened.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ruben Ortega added a triple and an RBI.</li>
  <li>The lineup piled on six more runs.</li>
  <li>Greg McClay dominated on the mound, throwing seven strong innings.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  By the final out, the message was clear: The Gargoyles weren’t just here to compete. They were here to take over.
</p>

<p><strong>Series Takeaways: The Moment New York Has Been Waiting For</strong></p>

<p><i>Newton Pederson Is the Face of This Franchise</i></p>
<p>
  We’ve seen glimpses of greatness from Pederson, but this series felt like the moment he became the guy. The two-way wizard made plays with the glove, crushed clutch home runs, and carried the offense when they needed him most.
</p>

<p><i>Pumroy’s Performance Can’t Be Overlooked</i></p>
<p>
  A complete-game, nine-inning gem against the defending champs? This was the outing that put Pedro Pumroy in the conversation as a legitimate ace.
</p>

<p><i>This Team’s Identity Is Toughness</i></p>
<p>
  Every game in this series was a fight. A battle of resilience. A test of belief. And the Gargoyles never backed down.
</p>

<p>
  With this three-game sweep, New York now sits at 10-2, riding a wave of momentum unlike anything this franchise has seen in years.

			<p><strong>GARGOYLES STUN CALAVERAS IN THRILLING WALK-OFF WIN - 03/30/1904</strong></p>

<p>
  Some games define a season—this was one of them. On a cold, rainy night at Gargoyles Field, the New York Gargoyles proved they belong among the league’s elite, 
  rallying in the bottom of the ninth to stun the defending World Series champion Tijuana Calaveras, 3-2.
</p>

<p>
  For eight grueling innings, Tijuana’s ace Eddy Reyna silenced New York’s bats, while Trevor Yale battled fiercely, allowing just one earned run over 
  eight innings in a near-flawless start. But after Jonathan Cruz’s RBI triple in the ninth put the Calaveras up 2-0, the Gargoyles refused to fold.
</p>

<p>
  Facing one of the best bullpens in baseball, Francisco Cabanas, Nick Dove, and Cody Merritt all delivered clutch singles to load the bases. 
  Chris Hawthorne took a pitch off the body, forcing in a run, and when Newton Pederson put the ball in play, Tijuana’s defense cracked, 
  allowing the tying run to score. Then, with the crowd on its feet, John Casey delivered the moment of the season—a walk-off RBI single to 
  complete the stunning comeback.
</p>

<p><strong>Takeaways from a Statement Win:</strong></p>
<p><i>Yale Goes Toe-to-Toe with an Ace</i></p>
<p>
  Eight innings of dominance, keeping the Gargoyles within striking distance.
</p>
<p><i>Never Say Die Mentality</i></p>
<p>
  Down to their final outs, New York broke through against an elite pitching staff.
</p>
<p><i>Tijuana Feels the Pressure</i></p>
<p>
  The champs came in confident but cracked under the lights in the ninth.
</p>

<p>
  With this monumental win, the Gargoyles improve to 8-2 and send a clear message to the league—this team is for real.
</p>

		<div class="sblgame-box">
			<p><strong>GARGOYLES TAKE TWO OF THREE FROM CARS IN HARD-FOUGHT SERIES</strong></p>

<p>
  The New York Gargoyles went into Detroit and emerged with a series win, taking two of three against the Cars at Cars Ballpark. 
  After a tough loss in the opener, New York responded with back-to-back victories behind strong pitching and timely hitting.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 1: Gargoyles Struggle as Cars Roll to 7-1 Win</strong></p>
<p>
  Detroit took full advantage of New York’s defensive lapses, scoring early and never looking back. The Gargoyles committed four errors, 
  leading to multiple unearned runs that put them in an early hole.
</p>
<p>
  Greg McClay, fresh off a dominant season debut, couldn’t overcome the shaky defense behind him. The left-hander allowed seven runs 
  (three earned) across six innings, while Detroit capitalized with key hits from Gabe Lopez and Tim Rayle.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, New York’s offense never found its rhythm against Luke Barnes, who threw a complete-game six-hitter. The Gargoyles had a 
  chance to climb back in the eighth, loading the bases with one out, but Steve Erickson bounced into a force play to kill the rally.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 2: Wirths Shines as New York Bounces Back with 7-3 Win</strong></p>
<p>
  Mike Wirths delivered a rock-solid performance to even the series, allowing just one earned run over seven innings. The right-hander 
  kept the Cars’ bats quiet while striking out six.
</p>
<p>
  Offensively, the Gargoyles applied pressure early and often. A first-inning rally, sparked by Nick Dove and Ruben Ortega, put New York 
  ahead quickly. John Gruber broke the game open in the sixth with a clutch RBI double, and New York tacked on insurance runs late.
</p>
<p>
  The Cars had their opportunities, but Detroit’s defense faltered, committing four errors that led to extra chances for the Gargoyles.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 3: Cabanas and Gonzalez Deliver as New York Wins the Series, 5-2</strong></p>
<p>
  New York took the rubber match with another strong pitching effort, this time from Carlos Gonzalez. The right-hander went seven innings, 
  allowing just one run while escaping multiple jams.
</p>
<p>
  Francisco Cabanas provided the big blow, delivering a two-run single in the fourth to extend New York’s lead to 5-1. Ruben Ortega and 
  Newton Pederson also chipped in with key hits.
</p>
<p>
  Detroit mounted a minor threat in the eighth, cutting the deficit to three, but Steve Erickson shut the door in the ninth to secure the win.
</p>

<p><strong>Series Takeaways:</strong></p>
<p><i>Defensive Miscues Almost Cost the Series</i></p>
<p>
  New York’s usually steady defense was anything but in Game 1, with four errors leading directly to runs. If they clean it up, this series 
  doesn’t feel as close.
</p>
<p><i>Wirths and Gonzalez Continue to Impress</i></p>
<p>
  The back-end of the rotation stepped up in a big way, with both Wirths and Gonzalez keeping Detroit’s offense in check.
</p>
<p><i>Cabanas Getting Hot at the Right Time</i></p>
<p>
  After a slow start to the season, Francisco Cabanas came alive in Game 3. If this is a sign of things to come, the Gargoyles’ offense will 
  only get stronger.
</p>
<p>
  With the series win, New York improves to 7-2 and will look to keep rolling as they return home.

			<p><strong>GARGOYLES SWEEP PIONEERS, IMPROVE TO 5-1</strong></p>

<p>
  The New York Gargoyles continued their hot start to the season, sweeping the Portland Pioneers in a
  three-game series at Gargoyles Field. Strong starting pitching and timely hitting powered New York to
  convincing wins in the first two games, before a tense pitcher's duel in Game 3 sealed the sweep.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 1: Gargoyles Overpower Pioneers, 9-3</strong></p>
<p>
  New York wasted no time setting the tone, exploding for six runs in the second inning to put the game
  out of reach early. Catcher John Casey’s two-run single sparked the rally, while Newton Pederson and
  John Gruber added key RBIs.
</p>
<p>
  On the mound, Carlos Gonzalez was dominant, tossing seven strong innings while allowing just two runs.
  Portland’s offense struggled to capitalize on its few opportunities, and New York cruised to an easy win.
</p>
<p>
  The Gargoyles’ defense had a few hiccups, committing two errors, but the offensive outburst more than
  covered for them.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 2: New York Rolls to 13-2 Blowout</strong></p>
<p>
  The Gargoyles’ bats came alive in Game 2, putting up seven runs in the first inning and never looking back.
  Third baseman Nick Dove had a huge night, going 4-for-6 with three RBIs, while Newton Pederson
  continued his strong series with another multi-RBI performance.
</p>
<p>
  On the mound, Pedro Pumroy delivered a gem, scattering just a handful of hits while keeping the Pioneers
  off the board until the final inning. Portland’s defense collapsed under the pressure, committing multiple
  errors that led to extra runs for New York.
</p>
<p>
  With the game well in hand, New York’s bullpen closed the door without issue, securing their most
  lopsided win of the young season.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 3: Yale Shines in 2-1 Nail-Biter</strong></p>
<p>
  After two high-scoring affairs, the series finale turned into a pitcher’s duel. Trevor Yale delivered an
  incredible performance, tossing 8.2 innings of three-hit baseball while striking out six.
</p>
<p>
  New York scratched across the go-ahead run in the sixth, as Newton Pederson doubled home Ruben Ortega
  in what proved to be the game-winning hit. Portland threatened in the ninth, but closer Steve Erickson
  came in to slam the door and complete the sweep.
</p>
<p>
  The Pioneers left multiple runners on base in key moments, unable to break through against Yale’s
  pinpoint control.
</p>

<p><strong>Series Takeaways:</strong></p>
<p><i>The Rotation is Carrying This Team</i></p>
<p>
  Gonzalez, Pumroy, and Yale all delivered fantastic starts, giving New York the foundation they need to
  push for a playoff run.
</p>
<p><i>Nick Dove is Red-Hot</i></p>
<p>
  The third baseman’s 4-for-6 explosion in Game 2 highlighted a strong start to the year. If he keeps this up,
  New York will be tough to stop.
</p>
<p><i>Pederson Continues to Come Through</i></p>
<p>
  Newton Pederson played a key role in all three games, driving in crucial runs and setting the table for the
  middle of the lineup.
</p>
<p>
  With a 5-1 record, the Gargoyles are showing they’re a legitimate contender. Up next, they look to
  continue their momentum as they hit the road for their next series.

			<p><strong>GARGOYLES TAKE TWO OF THREE FROM SPIDERS TO OPEN SEASON</strong></p>

<p>
  The New York Gargoyles started their 1904 campaign with a series win over the Los Angeles Spiders,
  taking two of three at Gargoyles Field. After dropping the season opener, New York responded with two
  convincing victories, led by strong pitching performances from Greg McClay and Mike Wirths.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 1: Rich Wilson’s Power Lifts Spiders to 6-2 Win</strong></p>
<p>
  Opening Day belonged to Rich Wilson, who flexed his power with a pair of home runs, driving in four runs
  to power the Spiders past the Gargoyles. New York struck first with two runs in the bottom of the first,
  but a costly third inning saw errors pile up before Wilson launched a three-run homer off Trevor Yale.
  The Spiders never looked back.
</p>
<p>
  Despite some promising moments from the Gargoyles’ offense—including a multi-hit game from Francisco Cabanas—
  missed opportunities and defensive lapses set the tone for the loss. Yale took the defeat, allowing five runs
  (two earned) across seven innings.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 2: McClay Spins Gem in 10-1 Rout</strong></p>
<p>
  If Game 1 was a stumble, Game 2 was a statement. Greg McClay dominated, throwing a complete game,
  four-hit masterpiece while striking out six. New York’s offense backed him up early, plating four runs in the
  first and never looking back.
</p>
<p>
  Nick Dove set the tone with an RBI triple, and Chris Hawthorne, Cody Merritt, and Newton Pederson chipped
  in with run-producing hits. A four-run sixth put the game out of reach, as the Gargoyles capitalized on a
  sloppy defensive night for Los Angeles.
</p>
<p>
  McClay’s performance gave New York its first win of the season in emphatic fashion.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 3: Wirths, Gruber Seal Series Win in 6-2 Victory</strong></p>
<p>
  New York kept momentum rolling in the finale, riding a strong start from Mike Wirths to a 6-2 win. The right-hander
  delivered 7.2 innings of two-run ball, allowing seven hits but working efficiently without issuing a walk.
</p>
<p>
  The Gargoyles grabbed an early 3-0 lead in the first, thanks to aggressive baserunning and opportunistic hitting.
  John Gruber provided the biggest blow late, knocking in two runs in the seventh to pad the lead.
</p>
<p>
  Los Angeles never recovered, with their only runs coming in the fourth and sixth innings.
</p>

<p><strong>Series Takeaways:</strong></p>
<p><i>Rich Wilson is a Problem</i></p>
<p>
  His two-homer Opening Day performance reminded everyone why he’s one of the most dangerous bats in the league.
</p>
<p><i>Gargoyles’ Rotation Looks Legit</i></p>
<p>
  McClay and Wirths delivered back-to-back quality starts, giving New York confidence in their pitching depth.
</p>
<p><i>Early Season Bats Heating Up</i></p>
<p>
  Francisco Cabanas, Nick Dove, and Cody Merritt all had strong series at the plate, setting the table for a promising offense.
</p>
<p>
  With a 2-1 start, the Gargoyles will look to build on this series win as they continue their homestand.

		 <p><strong>PORTLAND PIONEERS @ NEW YORK GARGOYLES - 02/15/1904</strong></p>

  <p>
    The Gargoyles got off to a promising start in their first spring training game,
    beating Portland 8–1 and showing off some much-needed spark after going down a run
    in the top of the first. Despite that early hiccup, Trevor Yale settled in on the mound,
    scattering just a couple of hits and striking out a handful of batters. His calm under
    pressure let the lineup regroup. Cody Merritt led off with a scorching double in the first,
    ultimately evening the score at 1–1, and from there, the offense kept chipping away.
    Willie Elizondo’s clutch RBI double in the fifth gave the team breathing room,
    and a four-run seventh blew the game wide open.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the best signs for the Gargoyles was how quickly new faces and bench players
    contributed after the mid-game substitutions—there were stolen bases, tough at-bats,
    and a few lucky breaks on passed balls and errors that swung momentum. Overall,
    it’s still spring training, but an 8–1 final in front of 1,217 fans is the kind of
    feel-good win that can set a tone for the season. If Yale keeps dealing and bats like
    Merritt, Elizondo, and the bench guys stay hot, this could be the year the Gargoyles
    finally reward that steadily growing fan base.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>

  <p><i>Trevor Yale’s Dominant Start</i></p>
  <p>
    After giving up a run in the first inning, Yale settled down and posted a Game Score
    of 63—showcasing control (49 strikes on 74 pitches) and composure. He got key groundouts
    when he needed them and kept Portland off the scoreboard until handing the ball over
    to the bullpen.
  </p>

  <p><i>The Offensive Surge in the Seventh</i></p>
  <p>
    The Gargoyles broke the game open with four runs in the seventh inning. From timely
    hits (like Mark Brooks’s single) to taking advantage of Portland’s mistakes (wild
    pitches and hit batters), they showed they can pile on runs when momentum is in
    their favor.
  </p>

  <p><i>Bench and New Faces Stepping Up</i></p>
  <p>
    Beyond regulars like Cody Merritt, players who came in during mid-game substitutions
    sparked the offense, contributed on the basepaths, and took advantage of defensive
    lapses by Portland. That depth is a welcome sight for a team looking to jump to the
    next level this season.

    <p><strong>Spring Training, Letter from Manager Donnie Heeler</strong></p>
    <p> &emsp;It’s the return of baseball—Monday, February 15th, 1904—and we’re back to the game. The New York Gargoyles are hotter than ever. Standing at a 107–145 overall record, we aim not only to finish with a winning season, but to bring home the World Series title. We’ve painstakingly worked to patch the holes in our game. Last year taught us a great deal, and we made strong strides. This season, we intend to put everything we’ve learned into action.
	    
<br><br>&emsp;We welcome many new faces, including Nick Dove, Newton Pederson, Ruben Ortega, Chris Hawthorne, and others. On the pitching end, we’re thrilled to add Trevor Yale to our roster.

<br><br>&emsp;A special thanks goes out to Bill DuPlantis, our Scouting Director, for his dedication in finding the talent that will help carry us forward. We also want to recognize NYG legends Cody Merritt, Francisco Cabans, and Mark Brooks for their continued support.

<br><br>&emsp;Finally, I want to thank our dedicated fans. We’ve seen reports that our fan base has grown by nearly 50,000 since 1901, and that unwavering support makes all the difference.

<br><br>&emsp;It’s going to be a great season for the Gargoyles this year—I can feel it, and I’m sure you can too.
