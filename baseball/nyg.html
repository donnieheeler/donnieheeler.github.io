			<p><strong>GARGOYLES TAKE TWO OF THREE FROM SPIDERS TO OPEN SEASON</strong></p>

<p>
  The New York Gargoyles started their 1904 campaign with a series win over the Los Angeles Spiders,
  taking two of three at Gargoyles Field. After dropping the season opener, New York responded with two
  convincing victories, led by strong pitching performances from Greg McClay and Mike Wirths.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 1: Rich Wilson’s Power Lifts Spiders to 6-2 Win</strong></p>
<p>
  Opening Day belonged to Rich Wilson, who flexed his power with a pair of home runs, driving in four runs
  to power the Spiders past the Gargoyles. New York struck first with two runs in the bottom of the first,
  but a costly third inning saw errors pile up before Wilson launched a three-run homer off Trevor Yale.
  The Spiders never looked back.
</p>
<p>
  Despite some promising moments from the Gargoyles’ offense—including a multi-hit game from Francisco Cabanas—
  missed opportunities and defensive lapses set the tone for the loss. Yale took the defeat, allowing five runs
  (two earned) across seven innings.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 2: McClay Spins Gem in 10-1 Rout</strong></p>
<p>
  If Game 1 was a stumble, Game 2 was a statement. Greg McClay dominated, throwing a complete game,
  four-hit masterpiece while striking out six. New York’s offense backed him up early, plating four runs in the
  first and never looking back.
</p>
<p>
  Nick Dove set the tone with an RBI triple, and Chris Hawthorne, Cody Merritt, and Newton Pederson chipped
  in with run-producing hits. A four-run sixth put the game out of reach, as the Gargoyles capitalized on a
  sloppy defensive night for Los Angeles.
</p>
<p>
  McClay’s performance gave New York its first win of the season in emphatic fashion.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 3: Wirths, Gruber Seal Series Win in 6-2 Victory</strong></p>
<p>
  New York kept momentum rolling in the finale, riding a strong start from Mike Wirths to a 6-2 win. The right-hander
  delivered 7.2 innings of two-run ball, allowing seven hits but working efficiently without issuing a walk.
</p>
<p>
  The Gargoyles grabbed an early 3-0 lead in the first, thanks to aggressive baserunning and opportunistic hitting.
  John Gruber provided the biggest blow late, knocking in two runs in the seventh to pad the lead.
</p>
<p>
  Los Angeles never recovered, with their only runs coming in the fourth and sixth innings.
</p>

<p><strong>Series Takeaways:</strong></p>
<p><i>Rich Wilson is a Problem</i></p>
<p>
  His two-homer Opening Day performance reminded everyone why he’s one of the most dangerous bats in the league.
</p>
<p><i>Gargoyles’ Rotation Looks Legit</i></p>
<p>
  McClay and Wirths delivered back-to-back quality starts, giving New York confidence in their pitching depth.
</p>
<p><i>Early Season Bats Heating Up</i></p>
<p>
  Francisco Cabanas, Nick Dove, and Cody Merritt all had strong series at the plate, setting the table for a promising offense.
</p>
<p>
  With a 2-1 start, the Gargoyles will look to build on this series win as they continue their homestand.

		 <p><strong>PORTLAND PIONEERS @ NEW YORK GARGOYLES - 02/15/1904</strong></p>

  <p>
    The Gargoyles got off to a promising start in their first spring training game,
    beating Portland 8–1 and showing off some much-needed spark after going down a run
    in the top of the first. Despite that early hiccup, Trevor Yale settled in on the mound,
    scattering just a couple of hits and striking out a handful of batters. His calm under
    pressure let the lineup regroup. Cody Merritt led off with a scorching double in the first,
    ultimately evening the score at 1–1, and from there, the offense kept chipping away.
    Willie Elizondo’s clutch RBI double in the fifth gave the team breathing room,
    and a four-run seventh blew the game wide open.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the best signs for the Gargoyles was how quickly new faces and bench players
    contributed after the mid-game substitutions—there were stolen bases, tough at-bats,
    and a few lucky breaks on passed balls and errors that swung momentum. Overall,
    it’s still spring training, but an 8–1 final in front of 1,217 fans is the kind of
    feel-good win that can set a tone for the season. If Yale keeps dealing and bats like
    Merritt, Elizondo, and the bench guys stay hot, this could be the year the Gargoyles
    finally reward that steadily growing fan base.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Highlights:</strong></p>

  <p><i>Trevor Yale’s Dominant Start</i></p>
  <p>
    After giving up a run in the first inning, Yale settled down and posted a Game Score
    of 63—showcasing control (49 strikes on 74 pitches) and composure. He got key groundouts
    when he needed them and kept Portland off the scoreboard until handing the ball over
    to the bullpen.
  </p>

  <p><i>The Offensive Surge in the Seventh</i></p>
  <p>
    The Gargoyles broke the game open with four runs in the seventh inning. From timely
    hits (like Mark Brooks’s single) to taking advantage of Portland’s mistakes (wild
    pitches and hit batters), they showed they can pile on runs when momentum is in
    their favor.
  </p>

  <p><i>Bench and New Faces Stepping Up</i></p>
  <p>
    Beyond regulars like Cody Merritt, players who came in during mid-game substitutions
    sparked the offense, contributed on the basepaths, and took advantage of defensive
    lapses by Portland. That depth is a welcome sight for a team looking to jump to the
    next level this season.

    <p><strong>Spring Training, Letter from Manager Donnie Heeler</strong></p>
    <p> &emsp;It’s the return of baseball—Monday, February 15th, 1904—and we’re back to the game. The New York Gargoyles are hotter than ever. Standing at a 107–145 overall record, we aim not only to finish with a winning season, but to bring home the World Series title. We’ve painstakingly worked to patch the holes in our game. Last year taught us a great deal, and we made strong strides. This season, we intend to put everything we’ve learned into action.
	    
<br><br>&emsp;We welcome many new faces, including Nick Dove, Newton Pederson, Ruben Ortega, Chris Hawthorne, and others. On the pitching end, we’re thrilled to add Trevor Yale to our roster.

<br><br>&emsp;A special thanks goes out to Bill DuPlantis, our Scouting Director, for his dedication in finding the talent that will help carry us forward. We also want to recognize NYG legends Cody Merritt, Francisco Cabans, and Mark Brooks for their continued support.

<br><br>&emsp;Finally, I want to thank our dedicated fans. We’ve seen reports that our fan base has grown by nearly 50,000 since 1901, and that unwavering support makes all the difference.

<br><br>&emsp;It’s going to be a great season for the Gargoyles this year—I can feel it, and I’m sure you can too.
