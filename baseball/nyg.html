    <p><strong>Spring Training, Letter from Manager Donnie Heeler</strong></p>
    <p> &emsp;It’s the return of baseball—Monday, February 15th, 1904—and we’re back to the game. The New York Gargoyles are hotter than ever. Standing at a 107–145 overall record, we aim not only to finish with a winning season, but to bring home the World Series title. We’ve painstakingly worked to patch the holes in our game. Last year taught us a great deal, and we made strong strides. This season, we intend to put everything we’ve learned into action.
	    
<br>&emsp;We welcome many new faces, including Nick Dove, Newton Pederson, Ruben Ortega, Chris Hawthorne, and others. On the pitching end, we’re thrilled to add Trevor Yale to our roster.

<br>&emsp;A special thanks goes out to Bill DuPlantis, our Scouting Director, for his dedication in finding the talent that will help carry us forward. We also want to recognize NYG legends Cody Merritt, Francisco Cabans, and Mark Brooks for their continued support.

<br>&emsp;Finally, I want to thank our dedicated fans. We’ve seen reports that our fan base has grown by nearly 50,000 since 1901, and that unwavering support makes all the difference.

<br>&emsp;It’s going to be a great season for the Gargoyles this year—I can feel it, and I’m sure you can too.
