    <p><strong>Spring Traing, Letter from Manager Donnie Heeler</strong></p>
    <p> It is the return of baseball, Mon. Feb 15th 1904, and we are back to the game. New York Gargoyles return hotter than ever. Currently standing with a 107-145 record overall, we plan to not only 
	finish positively once again, but win the world series. We have paintstakingly taken to patching the holes in our game. Last year we learn so much and we made great strides even then. 
	This year, we will actually put into play all we have learned. We welcome many new faces and names to team Nick Dove, Newton Pederson, Ruben Ortega, Chris Hawthorne and others. 
	On the pitching end we welcome Trevor Yale. Special Thanks to Bill DuPlantis our Scouting Director.

	We also want to say a special thanks to NYG legends Cody Merritt, Francisco Cabans, and Mark Brooks.

	Also special thanks to our dedicate fans. We have reports that our fan base has grown by nearly 50k since 1901.

	It's going to be a great season for the Gargoyles this year. 
	I can feel it, and I'm sure everyone else can too.
