			<p><strong>5/3/2025, 3:52 PM: ELO Sorting My Baseball PC</strong></p>

			<p>
		 	 After a full morning elbow-deep in rankings, matchups, and tuning logic, I’ve landed on a system that’s finally doing what I need: making sense of my personal card collection using a dynamic, living rating model.
			</p>

			<p>
			<i>Why ELO?</i><br>
			I’m not trying to create some universal “value” system. This isn’t about market comps or PSA 10s. This is about how I feel about my cards—relative to each other. Sentimental weight, aesthetics, print run quirks, storylines—all of it can be surfaced if the system allows for fluid context. That’s what ELO does better than tier lists or 1–10 scoring. It gives each card the chance to rise, fall, surprise, or age like wine—based on real head-to-head outcomes.
			</p>

			<p>
			<i>The Current State</i><br>
			We now have 32 cards, each with its own rating, match count, and an assigned tier (S through D). Elo is calculated via a custom Google Sheets script, using a standard kFactor = 32, and ratings update automatically when matchups are marked "done".<br>
		The best cards right now:<br>
		Aaron Judge T210, Lindor Blue Atomic, and Nimmo Snapshots Auto — all sitting solidly in S-Tier with 10–15 matchups under their belts.<br>
		At the bottom:<br>
		Tony Gwynn Chrome, Vladdy Jr. Bowman, and J.P. Morgan Heritage have sunk to the D-Tier after repeated trials.<br>
		And in the middle? That’s where the most interesting movement happens. A-Tier and B-Tier are volatile, still tuning themselves.
