			<p><strong>5/3/2025, 3:52 PM: ELO Sorting My Baseball PC</strong></p>

			<p>
		 	 After a full morning elbow-deep in rankings, matchups, and tuning logic, I’ve landed on a system that’s finally doing what I need: making sense of my personal card collection using a dynamic, living rating model.
			</p>

			<p>
			<i>Why ELO?</i><br>
			I’m not trying to create some universal “value” system. This isn’t about market comps or PSA 10s. This is about how I feel about my cards—relative to each other. Sentimental weight, aesthetics, print run quirks, storylines—all of it can be surfaced if the system allows for fluid context. That’s what ELO does better than tier lists or 1–10 scoring. It gives each card the chance to rise, fall, surprise, or age like wine—based on real head-to-head outcomes.
