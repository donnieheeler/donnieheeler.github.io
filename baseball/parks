			<p><strong>League Championship Series Recap</strong></p>

<p>
  The New York Gargoyles' run in the League Championship Series came to a crushing end as they were swept in four games by the Detroit Cars. 
  The series was a complete disaster for New York, who struggled to find any footing against a dominant Detroit squad.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 1: Detroit 4, New York 0</strong></p>
<p>
  New York was shut out in the opener at home, completely overmatched by Detroit ace Javier Cordovi. 
  He threw a complete-game shutout, allowing just five hits while New York’s bats failed to generate any offensive momentum.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 2: Detroit 12, New York 5</strong></p>
<p>
  The Gargoyles briefly showed life, putting up five runs, but their pitching collapsed under the weight of Detroit’s relentless lineup. 
  Gabe Lopez starred for the Cars with a three-hit performance, including a triple. A disastrous eighth inning for New York sealed the loss, 
  as Detroit pulled away late.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 3: Detroit 4, New York 0</strong></p>
<p>
  Back in Detroit, the Gargoyles continued their struggles at the plate. Luke Barnes followed Cordovi’s lead with another complete-game shutout, 
  holding New York to just five hits. The Gargoyles’ offense, which had been inconsistent all season, completely disappeared when it mattered most.
</p>

<p><strong>Game 4: Detroit 4, New York 2</strong></p>
<p>
  With elimination looming, New York needed a spark but failed to generate enough offense once again. Despite an early tie game, 
  Detroit broke through in the sixth inning, pushing three runs across to take a commanding lead. Cordovi once again proved to be too much to handle, 
  securing the series MVP with another brilliant outing.
</p>

<p><strong>Series Summary</strong></p>
<p>
  This series was an absolute nightmare for New York. The team failed to score in two of the four games, and when they did manage some runs, 
  their pitching couldn’t hold off Detroit’s relentless offense. The Gargoyles simply had no answers for Cordovi and Barnes, 
  who combined to allow just two runs across three starts.
