	<h2 style="text-align: center;">Sunday Afternoon on 15th St.</h2>
	</header>
  
	<main>
<p>The sun, it hides, yet the light remains<br>
as I make my way toward baser pleasures.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;>A woman walks<br>
by her mother’s side,<br>
who on her feet,<br>
wears tennis balls,<br>
and across the street,<br>
a jogger hustles,<br>
who on her feet,<br>
wears sneaker shoes.</p>

<p>I pass five children,<br>
all princesses,<br>
whose reign decrees<br>
five hula hoops.</p>

<p>From down the street,<br>
quickly approaching,<br>
two teenage riders,<br>
loud mower sounds—<br>
on minibikes—one rides it solo,<br>
and on the other,<br>
a woman sits,<br>
upon his lap.</p>

<p>I keep on walking,<br>
the sound, it fades.<br>
The trees, they speak,<br>
with late-day breeze.<br>
I see a father,<br>
his son beside him.<br>
Their work is silent—<br>
a pickup truck.</p>

<p>The day is ending,<br>
and you’d be forgiven<br>
if you concluded<br>
there was peace on Earth,<br>
from walking down<br>
15th Street<br>
on this Sunday afternoon.</p>
